Subject: Reversing a List, please help!


Please help!

I need to write a program that reverses a list. 

Can someone please send me the code that reverses a list.

I need the program to do this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1 [45pts]. 
Create a module called "rev" that reverses the list of elements
received along its North input. The list of elements E1, E2, E3, ...
En is represented as follows:

Inl(E1, Inl(E2, Inl(E3, ... Inl(En, Inr ()) ...)))

The module should send along its east output:

Inl(En, ... Inl(E3, Inl(E2, Inl(E1, Inr ()))) ...)
---------------------------------------------------------------------



Please help I do not know how to do this and I need to do it by tomorrow.

HELP THANK YOU!!!!!
