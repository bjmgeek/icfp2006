Subject: Is this thing on??

Hey,

 I sent out an announcement for 2D almost a month ago. Is anybody in
newsland using it? I've been using it in my undergraduate class
"Introduction to Programming Languages" this semester with great
success. The students love it!

 Let me make a challenge: I've attached an implementation of addition
for unary numbers (0 is represented as Inr (), 1 as Inl(Inr ()),
2 as Inl(Inl(Inr ())) and so on) in 2D. See if you can write a module
called "mult" (you can even use my "plus" module) whose output is
the product of its north and west inputs. The first one to send me
a correct solution gets a package of gobstoppers!
